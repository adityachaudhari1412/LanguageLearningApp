The Spanish Language Learning Application is a mobile application that will allow users to learn Spanish through an interactive game-like experience. The application will have four featured sections; vocabulary, writing, speaking, and listening. On the splash page, the user will be able to select one of the four features. Each featured section contains questions of varying difficulty. The vocabulary feature contains beginner vocabulary words in a multiple-choice format. The medium vocabulary mode contains advanced vocabulary words in a multiple-choice format. The hard vocabulary mode contains advanced vocabulary words in a fill-in format. For the writing phase, it is implementing a sort-of a fill in blank, or sentence completion game wherein those questions or daily-spoken phrases in Spanish will be provided. To accommodate the levels, the phrases will become more advanced and will require stronger proficiency. For the speaking phase, the intend is to implement an NLP/ML implementation based on voice detection. Wherein the user is asked to speak a certain word or a phrase and detected by the application whether what was said is accurate. The listening feature is out of this scope. A user of this application will need an internet connection to host the Spanish Language Learning Application from
AWS s3 cloud.
